### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because I learned how to convert fahrenheit to celsius. It was interesting because I learned that there are assignment operators which was utilized in making the formula. 

* Lab 3 
    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because I learned how to print out prompts with inputs and outputs. I was able to print out a sentence that followed a certain pattern relating to ingredients of a sandwich. 

* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because we calculated the date difference of the start and end of a Julian day. Then we subtraced the Julian day numbers to compute the date difference. It was more challenging compared to previous labs where we calculated the date difference. I liked analyzing the formulas and comparing them to previous ones!
