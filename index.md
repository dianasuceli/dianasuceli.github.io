### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

     Lab 2, part 1, was a favorite because I learned how to convert fahrenheit to celsius. It was interesting because I learned that there are assignment operators which was utilized in making the formula. 

* Lab 3 

     Lab 3, part 1, was a favorite because I learned how to print out prompts with inputs and outputs. I was able to print out a sentence that followed a certain pattern relating to the ingredients of a sandwich. 

* Lab 7

     Lab 7, part 1, was a favorite because we calculated the date difference between the start and end of a Julian day. Then we subtracted the Julian day numbers to compute the date difference. It was more challenging compared to previous labs where we calculated the date difference. I liked analyzing the formulas and comparing them to previous ones!
